# laravelRealtyBlog
A quick web app written on Laravel that imitates the most basic web forum; users can search for MLS and notes on those MLSs written by other users.
App was ran on scotch-box in my vagrant environment.

Users can create an account, enter posts on an MLS, view MLSs in order, search for MLS by title or code, see all associated posts for a given MLS. 

While brief, this hour-project shows my understanding of Laravel foundations, specifically the ways models function with views and how eloquent can be used to store and present data.

Files/folders to check for Laravel competency.
* app/models
* app/forms
* resources/views/ most files in this location, folders include MLS, notes, and registration

Let me know if you have any questions on my work.
